    <h2>Our Story</h2>
    <p>
      The desire to introduce the world to Nepalese culture gave rise to Dhago Clothing. 
       Dhago, which translates to "thread" in Nepali, is a representation of identity, history, and connection.  
       We support regional craftspeople and promote eco-friendly apparel by fusing contemporary design with traditional workmanship.
    </p>
    <p>
      Each piece tells a story of Nepal – from the colourful saris and cosy woollen shawls to the modern serwani that draws inspiration from our history.  
       We support fashion that honours people, culture, and the environment.
    </p>
    <br>
    <p>
      Nepal's varied ethnic groups and rich cultural legacy are reflected in the country's traditional attire. 
       The national clothing for men, the Daura Suruwal, which has historical roots in the Malla dynasty, is among the most recognisable outfits.
        Its components, a long tunic (Daura) and loose trousers (Suruwal), stand for cultural identity and patriotism.  Depending on the area, women typically wear saris or gunyu cholo.
       <br>

The majority of the natural raw materials used to make these garments are produced in Nepal. 
 One of the main basic materials is cotton, which is farmed in Nepal's Terai plains. 
 Because it is traditionally spun and woven by hand, it helps to support regional cottage industries and artists. 
 In addition to cotton, warmer and more resilient textiles are made in colder climates using hemp fibres and wool from Himalayan sheep.
<br>
The handcrafted wool and cotton textiles are light, soft, and appropriate for Nepal's diverse climate. 
 Every item of Nepali clothing tells a tale of culture, labour, and identity because weaving and dying are age-old crafts that have been passed down through the generations.

 Nepal's rich apparel legacy is preserved and celebrated via the use of natural fibres like Nepalese cotton and traditional craftsmanship.
