    <h2>Project Report</h2>
    <p>
      Shubham Adhikari my brother friend, launching an online Nepalese clothing brand. So he asked me to make him a website.
      For this project, I created a website for <strong>Dhago Clothing</strong>, a Nepalese clothing brand 
      that aims to combine traditional designs with modern fashion. The purpose was to build a 
      stylish, responsive website with at least four pages, using only HTML5 and CSS3.
    </p>

    <h3>Process & Planning</h3>
    <p>
      I began by outlining the requirements: the website would have a home page, a search button, a shop page containing products, a about page that would highlight the brand's history, and a contact page that would have a map and form. 
       Prior to coding, I also made basic layout sketches and a site map.  I utilised a dark blue colour scheme, Google Fonts for a contemporary appearance, and green to symbolise Nepalese culture through its relationship to nature.
    </p>

    <h3>Challenges</h3>
    <p>
      The biggest obstacle was that I was in my home country and couldn't physically attend class, so I missed the coding practice session when I could ask all of my questions in person, something I don't think was feasible online.  Making the website responsive for desktop and mobile visitors is one of my other issues.  For that, I also sought some assistance from chatgpt. 
       This problem was resolved with the use of CSS grid and flexbox.  Another difficulty I faced was making sure the gallery images loaded at the right sizes without causing the site to lag. However, your lesson, which included instructions on how to utilise GIMP, was helpful.
    </p>

    <h3>What I Learned</h3>
    <p>
      This project taught me how to use semantic tags,  to organise HTML.  Additionally, I worked on constructing a responsive navigation menu, adding hover effects, and creating layouts using CSS Grid and Flexbox.  I looked at utilising the W3C validators for HTML and CSS to check my code.
    </p>

    <h3>Reflection</h3>
    <p>
      Designing the Shop page and playing around with the product cards was the most fun aspect. 
       Setting up responsive graphics  was the most challenging aspects. 
       Overall, I believe I met the assignment's objectives and developed my confidence in building websites from the ground up, even if I did get some assistance from chatgpt. I also made an effort to understand the reasons behind my decision to make our site responsive.
    </p>

    <h3>Time & Effort</h3>
    <p>
      In a week, I spent 3 days (1-2 hour each day) planning, coding, testing, and writing this report (total approx=50 hours). 
      This included time spent searching for ideas, selecting images, and adjusting the CSS 
      to make the site look consistent.

        <h3>Site Map</h3>

        <h3>Design Choices</h3>

    <h4>Color Palette</h4>
    <div class="color-palette">
      <div class="color-box" style="background-color:#415d43;">
        <p>#415d43<br>Dark grayish lime green</p>
      </div>
      <div class="color-box" style="borderhover:White">
        <p>#FFFFFF<br>White</p>
      </div>
      <div class="color-box" style="nav-search:pink;">
        <p>#FFC0CB<br>Pink</p>
      </div>
      <div class="color-box" style="hero-message:#007185;">
        <p>#007185<br>Blue lagoon</p>
      </div>
      <div class="color-box" style="foot-panel:#222f3d;">
        <p>#222f3d<br>Yankees Blue</p>
      </div>
    </div>

    <h4>Font Preview</h4>
    <div class="font-preview">
      <p class="Arial">Heading Example (Arial,Helvetica, sans-serif)</p>
      <p class="sans-serif">Body Text Example (Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif)</p>
    </div>


    <h3>Conclusion</h3>
    <p>
      I gained a better understanding of the foundations of web design and development thanks to this assignment. 
       I'm more at ease creating multi-page websites and maintaining their style now. 
       If I were to make the website even better, I would incorporate JavaScript for a shopping cart and perhaps move to a content management system (CMS) like Shopify for actual e-commerce requirements.
